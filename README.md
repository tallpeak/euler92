Solutions to Project Euler # 92 in 18 languages (was 7, then 11)

This is a very trivial problem to solve in the brute-force way I chose 
(There is a combinatorial solution as well, but I was treating 
this solution as a sort of benchmark.) It's just a bit *too* trivial,
however I've found translating solutions from C to Zig or from Go to V
to be a quick and easy way to learn a surprising number of language
features in about 5 to 30 minutes per solution.

(Except that, my first attempt in Rust was going to include a cache
or memoization, but I failed at that attempt, after trying for well
over an hour. Perhaps I should go back and try again...)
